		<h2>Announcements</h2>

		<p>Here are the current announcements for this website. Will you read them? Probably not. Should you read them?
		Also probably not. But if you do choose to read them and engage in the simplicity that is the french revolution (
		a metaphor you surely do not understand), I 
		welcome you to our cause site hope you enjoy your stay here. Now that we are done with all the formalities, we can now
		begin our announcements page.</p>
		<ul>
			<li> <h3>Political Correctness</h3>
				<p>We will soon announce the release date of our political correctness course. 
				this will teach you everything you know about how to stay politically correct without sounding like a condescending douchebag. This course will teach you all topics to avoid at all costs, and will also show you how to properly act in situations where you may not be aware of the proper way to speak, but still want to act superior to everyone else you are in the room with. Why is this necessary you may ask? I don't know either, but we both know you'll buy this course anyways.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h3>Climate Change and the Political Extremization of the United States</h3>
				<p>I am pleased to announce the impending doom of this planet as all of you puny Americans know it.</p>

			</li>

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Here is some information about me. I know none of you asked, and even less of you want to know this, but I honestly don't care about what you think, so here you go anyways. If you do end up reading this for some reason,
		I guess thank you. I definitely don't deserve the attention, but I appreciate you wasting your already pointless lives reading this.</p>
		<br>

		<h3>Username</h3>
		<p>As even the dimmest of you morons have probably already realized, my username is karate7800, and as you can guess it bears absolutely no relevance to my life. Have I done karate? No. Do the numbers 7800 bear any personal meaning or whatever other bullshit people say to justify usernames? No. Was this section a complete waste of your time? Absolutely.</p>
		<br>

		<h3>Video Games</h3>
		<p>As anyone that has known me for more than 2 seconds has hopefully realized I play video games. But what video games do I play? Any real gamer can figure out what games I play. None of that Nintendo shit weeaboos fantasize over. I play Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto (if you can't figure out which one, you need to be put in a special type of chair), random io games when my friends are offline and my minecraft "friends" are too busy fantasizing over foxes (believe it or not that will also piss a duck off) or salivating over overpriced headphones and overdosing on energy drinks, occasional Muck when I want to throw heavy ordinances among other games.</p>
