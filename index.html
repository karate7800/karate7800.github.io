        <h2> About Me</h2>

        <p>I am an 18 year old sex deprived child. I am interested in video games (the real kind, not the games Nintendo weeaboos fantasize over) as well as programming.
          Throughout my experience I have programmed everything from discord bots, small games such as Pong and Tetris, and fancy websites.
          While I do regret showing you this site and having you disgrace this beauty of a website, I do begrudgingly welcome you here, and permit you to look around
          - the more time you spend here the less time you'll spend fantasizing over Pokimane. </p>

        <h2>Sex Life</h2>
        <p>As the existence of this website may suggest, I am very sex deprived and do not even have a twinkle of hope for that to change.
          While I am a firm believer that everyone deserves to experience the beauty of sex once in their pitiful lives,
          I am wise enough to realize you will never experience that without dishing out thousands of dollars.

        <h2>Math Competitions </h2>
        <p>If you are stupid enough to believe I have any interest in math competitions, you really need
          therapy. It doesn't matter if your therapy is getting drunk for a full week, or spending thousands of
          dollars to get railed, anything to help you relax and see how worthless math competitions are,
          and to hopefully reevaluate how stupid your opinion really is. </p>

      <h2>Courses</h2>

        in price, in usefulness. We have a 30 minute satisfaction guarantee,
        so if you are unsatisfied with your lesson within 30 minutes of
