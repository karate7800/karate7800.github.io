		<h2>Announcements</h2>

		<p>Here are the current announcements for this website. Will you read them? Probably not. Should you read them?
		Also probably not. But if you do choose to read them and engage in the simplicity that is the french revolution (
		a metaphor you surely do not understand), I 
		welcome you to our site and hope you enjoy your stay here. Now that we are done with all the formalities, we can now
		begin our announcements section.</p>
		<ul>
			<li> <h3>Political Correctness</h3>
				<p>We will soon announce the release date of our political correctness course. 
				this will teach you everything you know about how to stay politically correct without sounding like a condescending douchebag. This course will teach you all topics to avoid at all costs, and will also show you how to properly act in situations where you may not be aware of the proper way to speak, but still want to act superior to everyone else you are in the room with. Why is this necessary you may ask? I don't know either, but we both know you'll buy this course anyways.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h3>Climate Change and the Political Extremization of the United States</h3>
				<p>I am pleased to announce the impending doom of this planet as all of you puny Americans know it.</p>

			</li>

			<li>
				<h3>Gradients</h3>
				<p>I have figured out how to use CSS Gradients and as thus will use them everything. At least I think I did I have no fucking clue. Believe it or not, I'm more than capable of not acting like a self righteous know-it-all even though I choose not to, and I do acknowledge when I don't understand something.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h3>Women</h3>
				<p>I do not understand these things. If you are either one of them or by some miracle do understand it, please do contact me.</p>
			</li>

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Here is some information about me. I know none of you asked, and even less of you want to know this, but I honestly don't care about what you think, so here you go anyways. If you do end up reading this for some reason,
		I guess thank you. I definitely don't deserve the attention, but I appreciate you wasting your already pointless lives reading this.</p>
		<br>

		<h3>Username</h3>
		<p>As even the dimmest of you morons have probably already realized, my username is karate7800, and as you can guess it bears absolutely no relevance to my life. Have I done karate? No. Do the numbers 7800 bear any personal meaning or whatever other bullshit people say to justify usernames? No. Was this section a complete waste of your time? Absolutely.</p>
		<br>

		<h3>Video Games</h3>
		<p>As anyone that has known me for more than 2 seconds has hopefully realized I play video games. But what video games do I play? Any real gamer can figure out what games I play. None of that Nintendo shit weeaboos fantasize over. I play Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto (if you can't figure out which one, you need to be put in a special type of chair), random io games when my friends are offline and my minecraft "friends" are too busy fantasizing over foxes (believe it or not that will also piss a duck off) or salivating over overpriced headphones and overdosing on energy drinks, occasional Muck when I want to throw heavy ordinances among other games.</p>

		<br>
		<h3>School</h3>
		<p>I graduated High School in 2021. I won't tell you which high school or which college I am going to (if you already know congratulations) because I'd rather not get visited by you fanboys, but know both are above average for the state. As is normal, please do not attempt to figure out which college I am going to. I am likely going to major in Data Science, and that is far too much information and money for you puny non engineering majors to comprehend. And before you art majors message me about how successful your Youtube channels and Pornhub channels will become, just know you'll never afford the plastic surgery to succeed on the latter and are not nearly funny or charismatic enough to succeed on the former. Any 2 year old can use autotune, and if you decide to make a career <i>"parodying"</i> existing music, just wait until the copyright cases force you to go under and realize that you are not creative in the slightest no matter how many Minecraft fanboys you think are on your side. And if you try to be cheeky and make art instead, just realize that while there are enough Neo Nazis to support you once you get rejected from art school in America alone, there is no chance you will actually be able to take over half of Europe like your idol once did.</p>

		<h2>Handouts/Notes</h2>
		<p>For those you wondering what the point of this section is, it is purely for advertisements. I will put absolutely anything legal here for money.</p>

	<section>
		<h2>Math</h2>
		<p>For those unaware of my interests, or those aware for that matter, you may wonder why this is a section on the website. For those in one group, you may know of me as the guy that bitched about multivariable calculus, for those in another group, well I'd rather not find out what you think of me. Please find below my list of accomplishments in this field: </p>

	<section>
		<h2>Love Life</h2>
		<p>For those of you wondering why this section exists, I honestly don't know either. My love life is nonexistent, and the one fling I did have ended because I was "too boring". But if a girl happens to see this page and is for some reason interested in me, I'd say check again after the alcohol wears off and message me on Discord or Instagram. </p>

		<h2>Contact Me</h2>
		<p>If you wish to contact me, there are several mediums throughout which I may be reached. I have Discord, Instagram, and Snapchat.</p>
